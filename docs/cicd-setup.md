# CI/CD Workflow Guide

This guide explains the GitHub Actions workflows that automate building and deploying the ADK agent to Cloud Run.

## Overview

The project uses **automated CI/CD** via GitHub Actions with three reusable workflows:

1. **`ci-cd.yml`** - Orchestrator (meta → build → deploy)
2. **`docker-build.yml`** - Reusable Docker image build
3. **`terraform-plan-apply.yml`** - Reusable Terraform deployment

**Key principle:** Zero manual intervention after initial setup. Merge to main = automatic deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before workflows can run, you must complete the one-time bootstrap setup:

1. ✅ Run `terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap apply` (see [Terraform Infrastructure Guide](./terraform-infrastructure.md))
2. ✅ Verify GitHub Variables created: `gh variable list`

Bootstrap configures **everything needed for CI/CD**: WIF provider with IAM bindings, Artifact Registry, GitHub Variables, and Terraform state bucket. **No manual configuration needed.**

## GitHub Variables (Auto-Created)

The bootstrap module creates these Variables in your repository:

| Variable Name | Description | Created By |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project ID | Bootstrap |
| `GCP_LOCATION` | GCP region | Bootstrap |
| `IMAGE_NAME` | Docker image name (also used as agent_name) | Bootstrap |
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | WIF provider resource name | Bootstrap |
| `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URI` | Registry URI | Bootstrap |
| `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_LOCATION` | Registry location | Bootstrap |
| `TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET` | GCS bucket for main module state | Bootstrap |

**Note:** These are Variables (not Secrets) because they're resource identifiers, not credentials. Security comes from WIF IAM policies, not obscurity.

## Workflow Architecture

### Three-Workflow Pattern

```
ci-cd.yml (orchestrator)
├── meta (job) - Extract metadata and determine tags
├── build (calls docker-build.yml) - Build multi-platform image
└── deploy (calls terraform-plan-apply.yml) - Deploy to Cloud Run
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable workflows called by orchestrator (no manual triggers)
- Direct output passing (no tag reconstruction)
- Single orchestrator controls the full pipeline

### Workflow Flow

**On Pull Request:**
```
1. meta job extracts: pr-{number}-{sha}
2. docker-build.yml pushes: registry/image:pr-123-abc123
3. terraform-plan-apply.yml runs: plan (no apply)
4. Plan output posted as PR comment
```

**On Push to Main or Version Tag:**
```
1. meta job extracts: {sha}, latest, {version} (if tagged)
2. docker-build.yml pushes: registry/image:abc123 + latest (+ v1.0.0 if tagged)
3. terraform-plan-apply.yml runs: apply (auto-approved)
4. Cloud Run service updated with image digest
```

**On Manual Dispatch:**
```
1. meta job runs (uses current commit SHA)
2. docker-build.yml builds image
3. terraform-plan-apply.yml runs plan or apply (user choice)
4. Workspace selection: default/dev/stage/prod
```

## Image Tagging Strategy

### Pull Request Builds

**Format:** `pr-{number}-{sha}` (e.g., `pr-123-abc1234`)
- Unique per commit, isolated from main builds

### Main Branch Builds

**Tags:** `{sha}` (primary), `latest`, `{version}` (if tagged)

**Example:** Commit `abc1234` tagged `v0.9.0` produces:
```
registry/image:abc1234  registry/image:latest  registry/image:v0.9.0
```

**Deployment uses image digest** (not tags) to ensure every rebuild triggers a new Cloud Run revision.

### Version Tag Builds

**Trigger:** Push git tag matching `v*` (e.g., `git push origin v0.4.0`)

Automatically builds version-tagged image after release PR is merged. Safe because tags point to already-reviewed code and only authorized users can push tags.

## Workflow Behavior

**Concurrency:** PRs cancel in-progress builds; main runs sequentially. Per-workspace Terraform locking prevents state corruption.

**Path filtering:** Triggers on code/config changes, ignores docs. See `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for complete path list. Tag triggers (`v*`) always run.

**Multi-platform builds:** Images built for multiple platforms (see `docker-build.yml`). Manifest auto-selects architecture.

**Build cache:** Registry cache with protected `buildcache` tag provides significant speedup on cache hits.

## Pull Request Comments

terraform-plan-apply.yml posts formatted comments showing format/init/validation/plan results with collapsible sections for detailed output.

## Workload Identity Federation

Keyless authentication via WIF: GitHub Actions requests OIDC token, GCP validates against WIF provider, grants temporary credentials scoped to repository.

**IAM roles:** See `terraform/bootstrap/main.tf` for complete role list.

## Testing Workflows

Manual trigger via `ci-cd.yml` orchestrator (also available via GitHub UI: Actions > CI/CD Pipeline > Run workflow):

```bash
# Trigger full pipeline (build + deploy)
gh workflow run ci-cd.yml \
  -f workspace=default \
  -f terraform_action=plan

# Verify deployment
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 5
gh run view RUN_ID
gcloud run services describe IMAGE_NAME --region=us-central1 --format="value(status.url)"
```

**Note:** `docker-build.yml` and `terraform-plan-apply.yml` are reusable workflows without manual triggers. Use `ci-cd.yml` to trigger the full pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

### Trace Deployed Image to Git Commit

```bash
# Get commit SHA from deployed image digest
gcloud artifacts docker images describe \
  "$(gcloud run services describe SERVICE_NAME --region REGION \
     --format='value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)')" \
  --format="value(tags)" | cut -d',' -f1
```

### Missing Variables

```bash
gh variable list  # Verify Variables exist
terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap apply  # Re-run if missing
```

### WIF Authentication Failed

```bash
# Check WIF provider
terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap output -raw workload_identity_provider

# Verify IAM bindings
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.members:principalSet*"
```

### Image Push Denied

```bash
# Verify artifactregistry.writer role
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.role:roles/artifactregistry.writer"
```

### PR Comment Not Posted

Ensure workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission.

### Build Cache Miss

Builds taking longer than expected? Verify `keep-buildcache` policy exists in bootstrap module.

### Terraform State Lock

```bash
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 10  # Find stuck runs
gh run cancel RUN_ID  # Cancel if needed
terraform -chdir=terraform/main force-unlock LOCK_ID  # Last resort
```

## Workflow Timeouts

Workflows include timeouts to prevent runaway processes. See workflow files for specific values. If timeouts occur frequently, investigate network issues, large build context, or Terraform state locking.

## Security Best Practices

- **Keyless auth via WIF** - No service account keys, repository-scoped IAM bindings
- **Minimal permissions** - Only required IAM roles, workspace isolation for environments
- **Encrypted state** - Remote GCS state with versioning and locking
- **Immutable images** - SHA-tagged with cleanup policies, multi-platform manifests

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete bootstrap setup (see [Terraform Infrastructure Guide](./terraform-infrastructure.md))
2. ✅ Verify GitHub Variables: `gh variable list`
3. ✅ Test workflow: Create PR, verify plan posted as comment
4. ✅ Merge PR, verify automatic deployment to Cloud Run
5. 📖 Monitor deployments: `gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml`
