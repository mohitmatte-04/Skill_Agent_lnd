## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- CODEOWNERS file with fresh template replacement during init
- Init script now updates GitHub Actions badge URLs to point to new repository
- Init script now resets version to 0.1.0 in pyproject.toml
- Terraform infrastructure-as-code for GCP and GitHub configuration
- `terraform/bootstrap/` module for initial infrastructure (Workload Identity Federation, Artifact Registry, Reasoning Engine)
- `terraform/main/` module for Cloud Run deployment
- Automated GitHub Actions Variables creation via Terraform
- Artifact Registry cleanup policies (age-based deletion with version count protection and buildcache exemption)
- Required Terraform configuration entries in `.env.example` (AGENT_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER)

### Changed
- Init script now removes template author from pyproject.toml (developers no longer inherit template author info)
- Refactored GitHub info parsing to use tuples directly (removed dict conversion step)
- Made `github_owner` required in TemplateConfig (parsing is all-or-nothing)
- Improved agent directory discovery in server.py with file-based path resolution (using `.resolve()` for absolute paths and symlink resolution) and environment variable override
- GitHub Actions workflows now use Variables instead of Secrets for non-sensitive identifiers (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER)
- Renamed `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URL` to `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URI` for accuracy
- Simplified `AGENT_ENGINE_URI` to `AGENT_ENGINE` (URI prefix `agentengine://` now added in code)
- Server now defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for explicit IPv4 binding
- Dockerfile now explicitly sets `PORT=8000` environment variable for consistency
- `RELOAD_AGENTS` environment variable added for optional agent hot reloading (defaults to false)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- Template initialization script (`init_template.py`) with dry-run mode.
- Init script audit logs (`init_template_results.md`, `init_template_dry_run.md`) for change tracking
- Template setup documentation in README.md and docs/development.md
- InstructionProvider pattern for dynamic instruction generation (enables current dates, session-aware customization)
- MockReadonlyContext fixture in conftest.py for InstructionProvider testing
- Comprehensive prompt function tests (test_prompt.py, 13 tests)
- Integration tests for component wiring (test_integration.py, 5 tests)
- InstructionProvider pattern documentation in CLAUDE.md

### Changed
- Restructured package from nested `agent/` directory to flat structure (`agent.py`, `callbacks.py`, `tools.py`, `prompt.py` at root)
- Updated `global_instruction` to use InstructionProvider callable pattern instead of static string
- Sorted `LlmAgent` parameters in agent.py to match ADK field order
- Updated coverage exclusions in pyproject.toml (removed prompt.py, updated paths to flat structure)
- Updated test imports after package restructure (all existing tests passing)
- Docker Compose container name to `adk-docker-uv-local`
- Health endpoint response from `{"status": "healthy"}` to `{"status": "ok"}`
- Simplified development.md with project-specific examples
- Moved project structure documentation from README.md to development.md only

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- Google ADK agent with Gemini model integration and FastAPI server
- Dual authentication: Gemini Developer API or Vertex AI
- Agent lifecycle callbacks for logging and memory persistence (no short-circuits, all return None)
- Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Environment variable parsing utility for safe JSON list handling with validation and fallback
- Multi-stage Docker build with uv optimization (~200MB runtime image, 5-10s rebuilds)
- Docker Compose with hot reloading (instant sync for code changes)
- Code quality tooling: ruff, mypy (strict), pytest (100% coverage)
- GitHub Actions workflows for quality checks and Docker builds
- Comprehensive documentation (README, development guides, Docker strategy, CLAUDE.md)
- Environment-based configuration with optional Agent Engine and GCS integration
- `.vscode/settings.json` to configure Pylance (excludes tests from type checking)

### Configuration
- Type checking excludes tests (standard pytest pattern): mypy checks only production code
- Ruff excludes notebooks from linting
- Notebooks for Agent Engine creation
