## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Move OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT to required section in Terraform variables
- Prevent workload identity federation resource ID collisions by using GitHub repository ID instead of repository name, ensuring unique identifiers even for repositories with similar names
- Add `shell: bash {0}` to terraform plan for error output capture
- Truncate service account IDs to enforce GCP 30-character limit

### Added
- Dedicated bootstrap setup guide (`docs/bootstrap-setup.md`) with minimal commands and troubleshooting
- Comprehensive environment variables reference (`docs/environment-variables.md`) with WHEN/WHY/HOW context for each variable

### Changed
- Streamline developer onboarding: condense README from 170 to 106 lines (38% reduction), integrate template initialization into Getting Started Phase 1, remove duplication between Quickstart and Getting Started sections
- Condense development guide from 315 to 164 lines (48% reduction) with even density throughout, remove verbose code examples, combine related workflow sections
- Reorganize README Documentation section with logical grouping: Getting Started, Infrastructure and Deployment, Production Features
- Use generic placeholders (your-agent-name, your_agent_name) instead of adk-docker-uv in documentation examples
- Update project structure tree in development.md to reflect current files and directories
- Optimize CLAUDE.md for AI consumption: 36% size reduction (440→279 lines), replace verbose prose with dense technical summaries, update outdated utils references (env_parser.py → config.py/observability.py), add branch protection warning
- Add explicit project parameters to all GCP resources in bootstrap Terraform module for clarity and reduced misconfiguration risk
- Exclude main Terraform module lockfile from version control to prevent platform-specific conflicts from local testing (CI/CD-only execution)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- OpenTelemetry observability with trace export to Google Cloud Trace via OTLP and log export to Cloud Logging with automatic trace correlation
- Pydantic-based environment configuration (`ServerEnv` model) with type-safe validation and required field enforcement
- Comprehensive observability documentation (`docs/observability.md`) covering setup, resource attributes, and usage
- OpenTelemetry resource attributes for service identification: `service.name`, `service.namespace`, `service.version`, `service.instance.id`, and `gcp.project_id`
- Workspace-based resource naming in Terraform using `local.resource_name = "${var.agent_name}-${terraform.workspace}"` for environment-specific resources
- Automatic trace grouping by environment via `TELEMETRY_NAMESPACE` environment variable (set to workspace name in deployments)
- Billing labels (`application`, `environment`) on all GCP resources for cost tracking and organization
- UUID-based instance ID (`service.instance.id=worker-{PID}-{UUID}`) for collision-free process tracking
- Cloud Run revision tracking via `service.version` resource attribute

### Changed
- Required environment variables now include `AGENT_NAME` (service identifier) and `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (LLM content capture control)
- Terraform resources now use workspace-based naming for environment isolation (e.g., `my-agent-dev`, `my-agent-prod`)
- Cloud Run services automatically receive `TELEMETRY_NAMESPACE = terraform.workspace` environment variable for trace grouping
- Server startup now configures OpenTelemetry before ADK initialization for proper resource attribute propagation
- Environment configuration now uses Pydantic models with factory pattern (`initialize_environment`) for validation and error handling

### Fixed
- Add `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` to Terraform bootstrap and main modules for proper deployment configuration

### Removed
- File logging system with rotating handlers (replaced with cloud-native OpenTelemetry logging)
- `src/adk_docker_uv/utils/env_parser.py` module (replaced with Pydantic-based configuration)
- `src/adk_docker_uv/utils/log_config.py` module (replaced with `observability.py`)
- `tests/test_env_parser.py` and `tests/test_logging.py` (replaced with `tests/test_config.py`)
- Log volume mount from `docker-compose.yml` (no longer needed without file logging)

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-26

### Changed
- CI/CD workflows now use image digest (instead of tag) for Cloud Run deployments to ensure every Docker rebuild triggers a new revision deployment, even when tags are reused (e.g., base image security updates, manual rebuilds)

### Added
- "Image Digest Deployment" section in CLAUDE.md explaining digest-based deployment rationale and workflow
- "Tracing Deployed Image to Git Commit" troubleshooting section in docs/cicd-setup.md with gcloud commands to lookup digest → tags → commit SHA

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- Reusable CI/CD workflow pattern with three workflows: `ci-cd.yml` (orchestrator), `docker-build.yml` (multi-arch builds), `terraform-plan-apply.yml` (infrastructure deployment)
- Automatic CI/CD workflow trigger on version tag push (builds Docker images for `v*` tags)
- Smart image tagging strategy: PRs tagged as `pr-{number}-{sha}`, main branch tagged as `{sha}`, `latest`, and `{version}` (if git tag exists)
- PR automation with Terraform plan posted as comment on pull requests
- Workspace-based Terraform deployment supporting environment isolation (default/dev/stage/prod)
- GCS bucket for main module's remote state created by bootstrap module
- Vertex AI Reasoning Engine provisioning in main Terraform module for session/memory persistence
- GCS bucket for artifact storage in main Terraform module
- Docker image recycling pattern with nullable `docker_image` variable for infrastructure-only updates
- `docs/cicd-setup.md` documenting complete CI/CD workflow automation
- `docs/terraform-infrastructure.md` documenting bootstrap and main module architecture
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` providing detailed implementation guide
- `docs/production-environment-strategy.md` for future multi-environment planning

### Changed
- Changed default Terraform workspace from `sandbox` to `default` in CI/CD workflows to use Terraform's built-in default workspace while maintaining extensibility for multi-environment deployments (dev/stage/prod)
- Reorganized `.env.example` with purpose-based grouping (Required, GitHub CI/CD, Optional) and corrected variable names
- Bootstrap module now creates GCS bucket for main module's remote state and adds storage.objectUser role for state bucket access
- Main module now uses remote state in GCS (bucket created by bootstrap) with workspace isolation
- Cloud Run deployment now integrates with Vertex AI Reasoning Engine via `AGENT_ENGINE` environment variable

### Removed
- `docs/github-docker-setup.md` (replaced by comprehensive cicd-setup.md)
- `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml` (superseded by reusable workflow pattern)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (historical planning document, core implementation complete, architecture decisions preserved in terraform-infrastructure.md and cicd-setup.md)

### Fixed
- Documented IAM bucket access limitation in artifact storage bucket variable (project-level storage roles only work within same GCP project, cross-project access requires additional configuration)
- Cloud Run startup probe configuration now uses HTTP health checks with resilient retry strategy (5 attempts over 120 seconds) to handle container initialization delays
- Inline comment justifying `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` role requirement for Cloud Run service account attachment during deployment
- Documentation of `coalesce()` usage for empty string vs null handling in Terraform variables
- "Terraform Variable Overrides" section in terraform-infrastructure.md documenting GitHub Actions Variables pattern
- "IAM and Permissions Model" section in terraform-infrastructure.md documenting project-level IAM assumptions and cross-project limitations

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- CODEOWNERS file with fresh template replacement during init

- `terraform/main/` module for Cloud Run deployment
- Automated GitHub Actions Variables creation via Terraform
- Artifact Registry cleanup policies (age-based deletion with version count protection and buildcache exemption)
- Required Terraform configuration entries in `.env.example` (AGENT_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER)

### Changed
- Init script now removes template author from pyproject.toml (developers no longer inherit template author info)
- Refactored GitHub info parsing to use tuples directly (removed dict conversion step)
- Made `github_owner` required in TemplateConfig (parsing is all-or-nothing)
- Improved agent directory discovery in server.py with file-based path resolution (using `.resolve()` for absolute paths and symlink resolution) and environment variable override
- GitHub Actions workflows now use Variables instead of Secrets for non-sensitive identifiers (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER)
- Renamed `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URL` to `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URI` for accuracy
- Simplified `AGENT_ENGINE_URI` to `AGENT_ENGINE` (URI prefix `agentengine://` now added in code)
- Server now defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for explicit IPv4 binding
- Dockerfile now explicitly sets `PORT=8000` environment variable for consistency

- Updated `global_instruction` to use InstructionProvider callable pattern instead of static string
- Sorted `LlmAgent` parameters in agent.py to match ADK field order
- Updated coverage exclusions in pyproject.toml (removed prompt.py, updated paths to flat structure)
- Updated test imports after package restructure (all existing tests passing)
- Docker Compose container name to `adk-docker-uv-local`
- Health endpoint response from `{"status": "healthy"}` to `{"status": "ok"}`
